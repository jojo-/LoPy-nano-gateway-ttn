# A nano gateway for The Things Networks with a LoPy 

This code allows to use the [LoPy 1.0](https://www.pycom.io/product/lopy/) board from Pycom as a single channel nano gateway for The Things Network.

The Things Network is a LoraWan-based communautary network for the internet of things (see [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) for more information). This code is powering the nano-gateway gateway of the [Wollongong Community](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community/wollongong/).

The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pycom/pycom-libraries/tree/master/examples/lorawan-nano-gateway).
